## Who is this for?
This project is intended for any developer or designer interested in creating apps in Flutter and contributing to online data privacy.

## How to Contribute as a Developer
We will have issues open for prioritized app features that open-source developers. Feel free to add ideas for features or bug fixes as issues on this repo. Contributions should be submitted as pull requests for review. See the CONTRIBUTING.md guide for more details! 

## How to Contribute as a Designer
We will have issues open for prioritized app features to be designed and implemented. For each feature, designers can submit links to Figma / Adobe XD as a comment on the GitHub Issue.

## Why The @platform
This open-source app is built on the @platform, a set of tools allowing developers to leverage existing app patterns to make use of the atProtocol. The @protocal allows two parties to securely exchange information (end-to-end encrypted). This technology was created by Atsign (atsign.com). This project leverages the atPlatformto accelerate Flutter development and ensure those who use the app have control over their data. See this developer website for more information about the technology (atsign.dev).
