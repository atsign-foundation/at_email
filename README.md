# Template README
This is template repository specifically for open-source app maintainers, with code (at_app), contributing guides, and packages. You can fork this repo to launch your open-source project. See (github.com/atsign-foundation/privatefit) as an example open-source project built on the @platform.

## App Overview
Start with an overview of your app. Open with intent - we welcome contributions - we want pull requests and to hear about issues.

## Who is this for?
The README should be addressed to somebody who's never seen this before.
But also don't assume that they're a novice.

## How to Contribute
This is where you give developers and designers guidance on how they can contribute to code. Normally, the repo should have issues for developers to work on and submit pull requests for.
